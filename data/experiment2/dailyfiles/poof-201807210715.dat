Arrested in 1962 as South Africa's apartheid regime intensified its brutal campaign against political opponents, forty-four-year-old lawyer and African National Congress activist Nelson Mandela had no idea that he would spend the next twenty-seven years in jail. During his 10,052 days of incarceration, the future leader of South Africa wrote a multitude of letters to unyielding prison authorities, fellow activists, government officials, and, most memorably, to his courageous wife, Winnie, and his five children. Now, 255 of these letters, many of which have never been published, provide exceptional insight into how Mandela maintained his inner spirits while living in almost complete isolation, and how he engaged with an outside world that became increasingly outraged by his plight. Organized chronologically and divided by the four venues in which he was held as a sentenced prisoner, The Prison Letters of Nelson Mandela begins in Pretoria Local Prison, where Mandela was held following his 1962 trial..."--cPublisher's website.10aMandela, Nelson,d1918-2013vCorrespondence. 0aPresidentszSouth AfricavCorrespondence. 0aPolitical prisonerszSouth AfricavCorrespondence. 4aNonfiction. 4aAutobiographies.1 aDlamini-Mandela, Zamaswazi,d1979-ewriter of foreword.1 aVenter, Sahm,eeditor.  yea18@cornell.edu:g1shp6350-afrzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/15879;Cornell  kUSDnhttps://www.amazon.com/Prison-Letters-Nelson-Mandela/dp/1631491172/ref=sr_1_1_atc_badge_A2N1U4I2KOS032_twi_har_1?ie=UTF8 & amp;qid=1532098776 & amp;sr=8-1 & amp;keywords=prison+letters+of+nelson+mandela kUSDq;Rush:i0
