Newsweek featured him on its cover under the headline "How Al-Sadr May Control U.S. Fate in Iraq." Paul Bremer denounced him as a "Bolshevik Islamist" and ordered that he be captured "dead or alive." Who is Muqtada al-Sadr, and why is he so vital to the future of Iraq and, arguably, the entire Middle East' In this compellingly readable account, prize-winning journalist Patrick Cockburn tells the story of Muqtada's rise to become the leader of Iraq's poor Shi'ites and the resistance to the occupation. Cockburn looks at the killings by Saddam's executioners and hit men of the young cleric's father, two brothers, and father-in-law; his leadership of the seventy-thousand-strong Mehdi Army; the fierce rivalries between him and other Shia religious leaders; his complex relationship with the Iraqi government; and his frequent confrontations with the American military, including battles that took place in Najaf in 2004. The portrait that emerges is of a complex man and a sophisticated politician, who engages with religious and nationalist aspirations in a manner unlike any other Iraqi leader. Cockburn, who was among the very few Western journalists to remain in Baghdad during the Gulf War and has been an intrepid reporter of Iraq ever since, draws on his extensive firsthand experience in the country to produce a book that is richly interwoven with the voices of Iraqis themselves. His personal encounters with the Mehdi Army include a tense occasion when he was nearly killed at a roadblock outside the city of Kufa. Though it often reads like an adventure story, Muqtada is also a work of painstaking research and measured analysis that leads to a deeper understanding both of one of the most critical conflicts in the world today and of the man who may well be a decisive voice in determining the future of Iraq when the Americans eventually leave. 7aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHYxGeneral.2bisacsh 4aElectronic books.40uhttp://rbdigital.oneclickdigital.com  aRecorded Books, LLCbRECEnrbeEB00575252  yah16@cornell.edu:g1sali houissahp2156-serv,remozPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/15165;Cornell  kUSDkUSDq;Rush:i005379cam a2200625Ki 450000100060000000300060000600600190001200700150003100800410004602000360008702000330012302000150015602000180017103500220018903700840021103700300029504000530032505000250037808200170040310000300042024500580045026400350050830000230054333600260056633700260059233800360061850400510065450505870070550502620129250601920155452014350174658800260318165000460320765000360325365000290328965000190331865000510333765000770338865000210346565000310348665000290351765500390354665500220358577601260360785600870373385600670382085601050388785600350399285601100402785600780413793800420421593800450425798001270430298103240442915164POOF2m     o  d        cr cnu---unuuu180416s2018    nyu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9781632863843q(electronic bk.)  a1632863847q(electronic bk.)  z1632863820  z9781632863829  a(OCoLC)1031373186  aB265E73F-65C8-461B-BEA1-155B87BA9B35bOverDrive, Inc.nhttp://www.overdrive.com  a9781632863843bCodeMantra  aMMIbengerdaepncMMIdNLEdEBLCPdTEFODdRECBK 4aSF250.5b.K87 2018eb04a637/.1092231 aKurlansky, Mark,eauthor.10aMilk! :ba 10,000-year food fracas /cMark Kurlansky. 1aNew York :bBloomsbury,c2018.  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aIntro; Half Title; Dedication; By the Same Author; Title Page; Contents; Epigraph; A Note about the Recipes; Part One: The Safety of Curds; 1.

But while mother's milk may be the essence of nourishment, it is the milk of other mammals that humans have cultivated ever since the domestication of animals more than 10,000 years ago, originally as a source of cheese, yogurt, kefir, and all manner of edible innovations that rendered lactose digestible, and then, when genetic mutation made some of us lactose-tolerant, milk itself. Before the industrial revolution, it was common for families to keep dairy cows and produce their own milk. But during the nineteenth century mass production and urbanization made milk safety a leading issue of the day, with milk-borne illnesses a common cause of death. Pasteurization slowly became a legislative matter. And today milk is a test case in the most pressing issues in food politics, from industrial farming and animal rights to GMOs, the locavore movement, and advocates for raw milk, who controversially reject pasteurization. Profoundly intertwined with human civilization, milk has a compelling and a surprisingly global story to tell, and historian Mark Kurlansky is the perfect person to tell it. Tracing the liquid's diverse history from antiquity to the present, he details its curious and crucial role in cultural evolution, religion, nutrition, politics, and economics.0 aPrint version record. 7aDairy products.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00886959 7aMilk.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01021615 7aHistoryxWorld.2bisacsh 0aMilkxHistory. 7aCookingxSpecific IngredientsxDairy.2bisacsh 7aTechnology & EngineeringxAgriculturexSustainable Agriculture.2bisacsh 7aHistory.2bicssc 7aCookingxHistory.2bisacsh 0aDairy productsxHistory. 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 4aElectronic books.08iPrint version:aKurlansky, Mark.tMilk!dNew York : Bloomsbury, 2018z9781632863829w(DLC)  2017039795w(OCoLC)1019607458403OverDriveuhttps://www.overdrive.com/search?q=B265E73F-65C8-461B-BEA1-155B87BA9B3540uhttp://public.eblib.com/choice/PublicFullRecord.aspx?p=53414944 3Imageuhttps://img1.od-cdn.com/ImageType-100/2183-1/{B265E73F-65C8-461B-BEA1-155B87BA9B35}Img100.jpg40uhttp://rbdigital.rbdigital.com4 3Imageuhttp://images.yourcloudlibrary.com/delivery/img?type=DOCUMENTIMAGE&documentID=qpmayz9&token=nobody40uhttps://nls.ldls.org.uk/welcome.html?ark:/81055/vdc_100056893669.0x000001  aEBL - Ebook LibrarybEBLBnEBL5341494  aRecorded Books, LLCbRECEnrbeEB00717902  ysek45@cornell.edu:g1sSarah Elizabeth Kennedyh1010-serv,remozPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/15164;Cornell  kUSDnRush order, patron request.
