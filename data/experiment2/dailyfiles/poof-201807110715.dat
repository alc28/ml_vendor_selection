Throughout the war on crime, police agencies have used traffic stops to search drivers suspected of carrying contraband. From the beginning, police agencies made it clear that very large numbers of police stops would have to occur before an officer might interdict a significant drug shipment. Unstated in that calculation was that many Americans would be subjected to police investigations so that a small number of high-level offenders might be found. The key element in this strategy, which kept it hidden from widespread public scrutiny, was that middle-class white Americans were largely exempt from its consequences. Tracking these police practices down to the officer level, Suspect Citizens documents the extreme rarity of drug busts and reveals sustained and troubling disparities in how racial groups are treated"--cProvided by publisher. 0aRacial profiling in law enforcementzUnited States. 7aDiscrimination in law enforcement.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00895102 0aDiscrimination in law enforcementzUnited States. 7aRacial profiling in law enforcement.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01086589 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst012041551 aShoub, Kelsey,eauthor.1 aEpp, Derek A.,eauthor.  aYBP Library ServicesbYANKn15125092  ynss3@cornell.edu:g1sh521-olinzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/15634;Cornell  kUSDnXBO  & amp; Notify Requestor, please.

Contesting gender in the contemporary courts.cJessica Carlisle.  aCham :bPalgrave Macmillanc2018.  a158 p.1 aGender and Politics8 aHow have Muslim marriages legally ended around the turn of the 21st century? Who has the power to initiate and resist shari?a derived divorce? When are husbands and wives made to bear the costs of their marital breakdown? What does divorce law indicate about the development of gender regimes in the Middle East and North Africa? This book opens with a description of the historical development of Islamic divorce in the MENA. Subsequent chapters follow a Syrian male judge, a Moroccan female legal advice worker and a Libyan female judge as they deal with divorce cases in which husbands, wives, their relatives and lawyers debate gender roles in contemporary Muslim marriages. MENA ?state feminism? has increasingly equalized men?s and women?s access to divorce and encouraged discussions about how spouses should treat each other in marriage. The real life outcomes of these reforms have often been surprising. Moreover, as the last chapter explores, jihadi proto-states (such as Islamic State) have violently rejected state feminist divorce law reform. This accessible book will appeal to students, researchers and a general readership interested in Islamic law; Middle Eastern studies; gender and sexuality; and, legal and social anthropology. 0aGender and politics.  aErasmus BoekhandelbERAAnNTS0000282520  yaa19@cornell.edu:g1sh2110-olinzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/15633;Cornell  kUSDnPlease notify the requester.
