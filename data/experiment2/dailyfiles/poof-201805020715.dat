Amongst other issues, it also looks at the challenges associated with bilingual and trilingual education in Xinjiang and Tibet as well as the mediation between religion and culture in multi-ethnic schools, covering these issues from a range of perspectives - Korean, Uyghur, Tibetan, Mongolian and Yi. The PRC promotes itself as a harmonious, stable multicultural mosaic, with over 50 distinct ethnic groups striving for common prosperity. Beneath this rhetoric, there is also inter-ethnic discord, with scenes of ethnic violence in Lhasa and Urumqi over the last few years. China has a complex system of multilingual education - with dual-pathway curricula, bilingual and trilingual instruction, specialised ethnic schools. This education system is a lynchpin in the Communist party state's efforts to keep a lid on simmering tensions and transform a rhetoric of harmony into a critical pluralistic harmonious multiculturalism. This book examines this supposed lynchpin"--cProvided by publisher. 7aLanguage policy.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00992402 0aEducation, BilingualzChina. 7aEducation, Bilingual.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00902886 0aLanguage policyzChina. 7aLinguistic minoritiesxGovernment policy.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00999187 7aMultilingualism.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01028907 0aLinguistic minoritiesxGovernment policyzChina. 0aMultilingualismzChina. 7aChina.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01206073  aYBP Library ServicesbYANKn12628330  aBaker and TaylorbBTCPnBK0017921434  aBrodartbBRODn114245584  ypjs3@cornell.edu:g1shp3350-olinzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/14280;Cornell  kUSDnhttps://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/language-power-and-hierarchy-9781474283441/

The trope 'well written' is widespread but it is rarely very clearly defined and not adequately described by theory. This book redresses that neglect by contextualizing writtenness as a focal issue in the contemporary context of international higher education. The quality of academic writing is often the source of both practical and ethical dilemmas in the academy, while at the same time the social value and productive role of the writing in the communication of knowledge are underestimated. The book interrogates the cultural power and value of writtenness, while also revealing its relative misrepresentation within academic culture at large. The conceptual relevance of writtenness is accentuated in the current geopolitical context of English language dominance, where it is at the hub of both centripetal and centrifugal forces. On the one hand, there is a widespread uniformity in notions of style and accuracy which academic writing is deemed to embody and represent, while on the other, with English as the lingua franca in different academic and geographic contexts globally, and different varieties of English proliferating, writtenness becomes a site of struggle."--cProvided by publisher. 7aLANGUAGE ARTS & DISCIPLINESxLinguisticsxGeneral.2bisacsh 0aReport writingxStudy and teaching (Higher) 0aEnglish languagexStudy and teaching (Higher)xForeign speakers. 0aCriticismxAuthorshipxStudy and teaching (Higher) 0aInterdisciplinary approach in education (Higher) 0aLanguage arts (Higher)xCorrelation with content subjects. 0aEnglish languagexRhetoricxStudy and teaching (Higher) 7aEDUCATIONxHigher.2bisacsh 0aAcademic writingxPolitical aspects. 7aWissenschaftssprache2gnd 7aAcademic writingxSocial aspects.2idszbzes 7aStudy and teaching (Higher)2idszbzes 7aEnglish languagexGlobalization.2idszbzes 0aAcademic writingxStudy and teaching (Higher) 7aEnglisch2gnd08iOnline version:aTurner, Joan, 1951-tOn writtenness.dLondon : Bloomsbury Academic, 2018z9781472508973w(DLC)  2017059198  aYBP Library ServicesbYANKn12601233  ypjs3@cornell.edu:g1shp3350-olinzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/14278;Cornell  kUSDnhttps://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/on-writtenness-9781472505071/ kUSDq;Rush:Noi9206354cam a2201093Ka 450000100060000000300060000600600190001200700150003100800410004601900590008702000360014602000260018202000150020802000180022302000230024102000330026402900220029702900230031902900210034202900220036303500210038503700270040604002210043304200080065404300210066205000240068305000230070707200230073007200250075308200200077808400180079810000380081624501260085426000940098030000380107433600260111233700260113833800360116449000340120050400510123450505940128550600540187952002960193353300840222953802370231354600130255058300850256358800260264865000480267465000280272265000510275065000590280165000320286065000410289265000230293365000660295665000590302265000490308165000400313065000300317065000220320065000280322265000270325065000410327765100160331865100190333465100480335365100370340165300170343865300200345565500220347577601740349783000350367185600590370685600470376585601210381285601050393385600590403885600810409785601490417885601170432785601210444485600580456585600580462385601060468193800280478793800330481593800350484893800400488393800410492393800300496498001180499498101480511214276POOF2m     o  d        cr un||||a|a||100707s2003    enk     ob    001 0 eng d  a606989180a650841569a794700940a994343869a1027027844  a9789882202924q(electronic bk.)  z9789622096233q(pbk.)  z9622096220  z9789622096226  z9622096239q(pbk.)  a9882202926q(electronic bk.)1 aAU@b0000514469491 aDEBBGbBV0431353611 aDEBSZb4218562111 aGBVCPb1003636497  a(OCoLC)646213868  a22573/ctt2bqjhhbJSTOR  aOCLCEbengepncOCLCEdN$TdEBLCPdOCLCQdMHWdE7BdOCLCQdOCLCOdJSTORdOCLCFdP@UdOCLCQdHEBISdOCLCQdYDXCPdCOOdOCLCQdOCLCAdOCLCQdCUSdOCLCOdOCLCAdMERUCdXFHdCN8MLdOAPENdKIJdAGLDBdOTZdOCLCQdIOGdEZ9  adlr  aa-cc---aa-cc-hk 4aLA1133.7b.F34 2003 4aJA88.C45bF35 2003 7aEDU0150002bisacsh 7aEDUx0150002bisacsh04a378.0150951221  aRR 699832rvk1 aFairbrother, Gregory P.,eauthor.10aToward critical patriotism :bstudent resistance to political education in Hong Kong and China /cGregory P.

But they all made a significant contribution to the cultural and intellectual history of America and ultimately changed the course of the twentieth century, in spite of the men who often undervalued or dismissed their work. These ten women--Dorothy Parker, Rebecca West, Hannah Arendt, Mary McCarthy, Susan Sontag, Pauline Kael, Joan Didion, Nora Ephron, Renata Adler, and Janet Malcolm--are united by what Dean calls "sharpness," the ability to cut to the quick with precision of thought and wit. Sharp is a vibrant depiction of the intellectual beau monde of twentieth-century New York, where gossip-filled parties at night gave out to literary slugging-matches in the pages of the Partisan Review or the New York Review of Books. It is also a passionate portrayal of how these women asserted themselves through their writing in a climate where women were treated with extreme condescension by the male-dominated cultural establishment. Mixing biography, literary criticism, and cultural history, Sharp is a celebration of this group of extraordinary women, an engaging introduction to their works, and a testament to how anyone who feels powerless can claim the mantle of writer, and, perhaps, change the world. -- Provided by publisher.10aKael, Pauline.10aArendt, Hannah,d1906-1975.10aMcCarthy, Mary,d1912-1989.10aWest, Rebecca,d1892-1983.10aHurston, Zora Neale.10aDidion, Joan.10aEphron, Nora.10aHellman, Lillian,d1905-1984.10aAdler, Renata.10aMalcolm, Janet.10aSontag, Susan,d1933-2004.10aParker, Dorothy,d1893-1967. 0aAmerican literaturey20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 7aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHYxLiterary Figures.2bisacsh 7aLITERARY COLLECTIONSxWomen Authors.2bisacsh 7aSOCIAL SCIENCExWomen's Studies.2bisacsh 0aWomen authors, Americany20th centuryxPolitical and social views. 0aAmerican literaturexWomen authorsxHistory and criticism. 7aBiographies.2lcgft 4aNonfiction.08iOnline version:aDean, Michelle, 1979-tSharp.bFirst Grove Atlantic hardcover edition.dNew York : Grove Press, 2018z9780802165718w(DLC)  2017059832  aYBP Library ServicesbYANKn14870278  yfmm1@cornell.edu:g1sFred Muratorih521-olinzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/14262;Cornell  kUSDnNYTBR; NEW  & amp; NOTEWORTHY kUSDq;Rush:Yesi26.0004487cam a2200637 i 450000100060000000300060000600800410001201000170005302000270007002000310009702000280012803500220015603701100017804001830028804200080047104300210047905000260050006600090052608200280053510000350056324501080059825000190070626400110072526400380073630000820077433600260085633700280088233800270091050400670093750504570100452002720146152012080173360000200294160000160296160000160297760000200299361000190301361000180303261000230305065000510307365000410312465000460316565000680321165000440327965000440332365000410336765000510340865000650345965100310352465100310355588000200358693800410360693800290364798001100367698100630378614261POOF2171109t20182018nyuaf    b    001 0ceng c  a  2017053089  z9781610398305q(ebook)  a9781610398299q(hardcover)  a1610398297q(hardcover)  a(OCoLC)1003305591  bPerseus Books Group, C/O Hachette Book Group USA 53 State st 9th Fl, Boston, MA, USA, 02109nSAN 200-2205  aPULbengerdacPULdBLPdFMGdPCXdIK2dOEMdIUKdIH9dIMTdTXKYLdBURdTYPMLdDLCdZVRdAZTdAZDdMCTdOCLCAdUABdIGAdT3BdTXWBRdVP@dMLYdMZ7dJBGdKCPdPNXdTEUdCNEDMdSSH  apcc  an-us---azo-----00aTL789.85.A1bD38 2018  cZsym00a338.7/6294092273aB2231 aDavenport, Christian,eauthor.14aThe space barons :bElon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the quest to colonize the cosmos /cChristian Davenport.  aFirst edition. 4c¬©2018 1aNew York :bPublicAffairs,c2018.  aviii, 308 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates :bcolor illustrations ;c25 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 279-294) and index.0 aIntroduction: "Touchdown" -- Part I: Impossible.

Nearly a half-century after Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, the Space Barons--most notably Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, along with Richard Branson and Paul Allen--are using Silicon Valley-style innovation to dramatically lower the cost of space travel in a bold quest to build a transportation network to the stars. These entrepreneurs have upended industry after industry and are now pursuing the biggest isruption of all--space--in an effort to make it more accessible to the masses. It's a challenge unlike anything they previously attempted, a grand adventure filled with risk, failure, and ultimately, a series of triumphant breakthroughs. Based on years of reporting and exclusive interviews with all four billionaires, The Space Barons is the ultimate drama of risk and adventure. It is also a classic story of rivals--hard-charging startups warring with established contractors and the personal clashes of the leaders of this new space movement, particularly Musk and Bezos, as they aim for the moon and Mars and beyond."--Dust jacket.10aBezos, Jeffrey.10aMusk, Elon.14aMusk, Elon.14aBezos, Jeffrey.24aSpaceX (Firm.)20aSpaceX (Firm)20aBlue Origin (Firm) 0aAerospace engineerszUnited StatesvBiography. 0aAerospace industrieszUnited States. 0aIndustrialistszUnited StatesvBiography. 7aTECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING / Aeronautics & Astronautics.2bisacsh 0aSpace industrializationzUnited States. 4aSpace industrializationzUnited States. 4aAerospace industrieszUnited States. 4aAerospace engineerszUnited StatesxBiography. 7aBUSINESS & ECONOMICS / Industries / Transportation.2bisacsh 4aOuter spacexCivilian use. 0aOuter spacexCivilian use. 46264-00cÔøΩ2018  aYBP Library ServicesbYANKn14786219  aBrodartbBRODn120787989  yfmm1@cornell.edu:g1sFred Muratorih521-uriszPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/14261;Cornell  kUSDnNYTBR; NEW  & amp; NOTEWORTHY kUSDq;Rush:Yesi28.0004479cam a2200625 i 450000100060000000300060000600800410001201000170005301900150007002000260008502000290011102000350014002000350017502000350021002000350024502000320028003500220031204001170033404200080045104300120045905000260047108200220049708400340051910000310055324501200058425000400070426400390074426400110078330000450079433600260083933700280086533800270089350000200092050504970094052015240143760000390296160000230300060000220302361000820304565000590312765000490318665000440323565000480327965000420332765000440336965000440341365000490345765000440350665000420355065500280359270000310362093800290365198001100368098100630379014260POOF2180126t20182018nyua          001 0aeng    a  2017061243  a1029058412  a1501187597qhardcover  a9781501187599qhardcover  a9781501187605qtrade paperback  z9781508250791qelectronic book  z9781508250784qelectronic book  z9781501187612qelectronic book  a1501187600qtrade paperback  a(OCoLC)1021056232  aDLCbengerdacDLCdOCLCOdBDXdSSHdIK2dZHBdQQ3dDADdBURdMEUdFM0dGO3dNDSdTXMALdILCdIHXdYDXdORZdKSU  apcc  an-us---00aHQ1236.5.U6bR53 201800a305.420973aB223  aBIO026000aBIO0220002bisacsh1 aRichards, Cecile,eauthor.10aMake trouble :bstanding up, speaking out, and finding the courage to lead /cCecile Richards with Lauren Peterson.  aFirst Touchstone hardcover edition. 1aNew York, NY :bTouchstone,c2018. 4c¬©2018  axii, 276 pages :billustrations ;c24 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aDon't let the bastards get you down -- Raised to make trouble -- Question authority -- It's not the work, it's who you work with -- Going for broke in Texas -- Don't wait for instructions -- Everything you need to know in life, you can learn on a campaign (and other lessons on raising activist kids) -- Say yes -- What would Ann Richards do? -- Resilience -- If it was easy, someone else would be doing it -- All in -- The resistance is female -- Epilogue: "Feminist" is not a passive label.  aCecile Richards has been an activist since she was taken to the principal's office in seventh grade for wearing an armband in protest of the Vietnam War. She had an extraordinary childhood in ultra-conservative Texas, where her civil rights attorney father and activist mother taught their kids to be troublemakers. In the Richards household, the "dinner table was never for eating -- it was for sorting precinct lists." From the time Richards was a girl, she had a front-row seat to observe the rise of women in American politics. She watched her mother, Ann, transform from a housewife to an electrifying force in the Democratic party who made a name for herself as the straight-talking, truth-telling governor of Texas. But Richards also witnessed the pitfalls of public life that are unique to women. Her experiences paint a powerful portrait of the misogyny, sexism, fake news, and even the threat of violence confronting those who challenge authority. As a young woman, Richards worked as a labor organizer alongside women earning minimum wage and learned that those in power don't give it up without a fight. Now, after years of advocacy, resistance, and progressive leadership, she shares her story -- from the joy and heartbreak of activism to the challenges of raising kids, having a life, and making change, all at the same time. She shines a light on the people and lessons that have gotten her through good times and bad, and encourages readers to take risks, make mistakes, and make trouble along the way.10aRichards, Ann,d1933-2006xFamily.14aRichards, Cecile,.10aRichards, Cecile.20aPlanned Parenthood Federation of AmericaxOfficials and employeesvBiography. 7aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Personal Memoirs.2bisacsh 0aLeadership in womenzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aWomen's rightszUnited StatesxHistory. 7aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Women.2bisacsh 0aWomen political activistsvBiography. 4aWomen's rightszUnited StatesxHistory. 4aSocial justicezUnited StatesxHistory. 4aLeadership in womenzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aSocial justicezUnited StatesxHistory. 4aWomen political activistsvBiography. 7aAutobiographies.2lcgft1 aPeterson, Lauren,eauthor.  aBrodartbBRODn120487012  yfmm1@cornell.edu:g1sFred Muratorih521-olinzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/14260;Cornell  kUSDnNYTBR; NEW  & amp; NOTEWORTHY kUSDq;Rush:Yesi27.0005133cam a2200565Ii 450000100060000000300060000600800410001201000170005302000280007002000410009802400250013903500220016404000650018605000250025108200160027610000310029224501500032325000190047326400380049230000580053033600260058833600330061433700280064733800270067550000440070250400410074650503300078752023320111760000620344960000690351160000360358060000430361664800200365965000630367965000690374265000600381165000540387165000540392565000660397965000550404565100450410065100550414565500390420065500410423970000440428093800410432493800290436598001100439498100630450414259POOF2180216s2018    nyua     b    000 0deng d  a  2018933667  a194812226Xq(hardcover)  a9781948122269q(hardcover) :c$35.003 a9781948122269d53000  a(OCoLC)1023084690  aYDXbengerdacYDXdBDXdZGXdOCLCFdGTAdBKLdILCdUTWdGO4 4aE185.97.K5bM37 201804a973.9232231 aMargolick, David.eauthor.14aThe Promise and the Dream :bthe Untold Story of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F.

Kennedy. Fifty years after they were both assassinated, noted journalist David Margolick explores the untold story of the complex and ever-evolving relationship between these two American icons. Assassinated only sixty-two days apart in 1968, King and Kennedy changed the United States forever, and their deaths profoundly altered the country's trajectory. As trailblazers in the civil rights movement, leaders in their respective communities, and political powerhouses with enormous personal appeal, no single pairing of white and black ever mattered more in American history. In The Promise and the Dream, Margolick examines their unique bond and the complicated mix of mutual assistance, impatience, wariness, awkwardness, antagonism and admiration that existed between the two, documented with firsthand interviews from close sources, oral histories, FBI files, and previously untapped, contemporaneous newspaper accounts. At a turning point in social history, MLK and RFK embarked on distinct but converging paths toward lasting change. Even when they weren't interacting directly, they monitored and learned from, one another. Yet the distance they maintained from one another reflected much broader tensions between the races in the United States, and their nearly simultaneous deaths embodied the nation's violent predilections and ongoing racial turmoil. Their joint story, a story each man took some pains to hide and which began to come into focus only with their murders, is not just gripping history but a window into contemporary America and the challenges we continue to face. Complemented by eighty-three revealing photographs by the foremost photojournalists of the period, The Promise and the Dream offers a compelling look at one of the most consequential but misunderstood relationships in our nation's history. "Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children." --Martin Luther King, Jr., 1967 "In this difficult day, in this difficult time... It is perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in." --Robert F.

He's just a guy trying to make it through each day while grappling with loneliness, alienation, violence--uncertain of his place in a culture that considers branding more important than being. Bob Honey has a hard time connecting with other people. He dreams he is sleeping with his ex-wife every night, and imagines waking up unhappy next to her every morning. Advertising, entertainment, and commerce rule his days; he's sick of being marketed to every moment, but is unable to pry himself away from the constant feed. A paragon of American entrepreneurialism, Bob sells septic tanks to Jehovah's Witnesses and arranges colorful pyrotechnic displays for foreign dictators. He's also a part-time assassin for an off-the-books program run by the CIA that targets the elderly, the infirm, and others who drain this consumption-driven society of its resources. When a nosy journalist starts asking questions, Bob can't decide if it's a chance to form some sort of new friendship or if it's the beginning of the end for him. With treason on everyone's lips, terrorism in everyone's sights, and American political life racing to ever-lower standards, Bob decides it's time to make a change. If he doesn't get killed by his mysterious controllers or exposed in the rapacious media first. Perfect for fans of books by Chuck Palahniuk and Hunter S. Thompson, Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff is a provocative, biting, timely novella that marks the publishing debut of one of America's most acclaimed artists"--cProvided by publisher. 4aAssassinszUnited StatesvFiction. 0aConsumption (Economics)vFiction. 0aInterpersonal relationsvFiction. 0aSales personnelvFiction. 1aInterpersonal relationsvFiction. 7aFICTIONxLiterary.2bisacsh 7aFICTIONxSatire.2bisacsh 4aConsumption (Economics)vFiction. 4aSales personnelxFiction. 0aAssassinszUnited StatesvFiction. 4aSan Joaquin Valley (Calif.)vFiction. 4aCaliforniavFiction. 0aSan Joaquin Valley (Calif.)vFiction. 0aCaliforniavFiction. 7aSatirical literature.2lcgft08iOnline version:aPenn, Sean, 1960-tBob Honey who just do stuff.dNew York : Atria Books, 2018z9781501189067w(DLC)  2018002029  aYBP Library ServicesbYANKn14744008  aBrodartbBRODn120611600  aBaker and TaylorbBTCPnBK0021373707  yfmm1@cornell.edu:g1sFred Muratorih521-olinzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/14246;Cornell  kUSDnNYTBR; NEW  & amp; NOTEWORTHY kUSDq;Rush:Yesi24.0002953cam a2200589Ii 450000100060000000300060000600800410001201900380005302000310009102000280012202900220015003500220017203700980019404001710029205000260046308200150048910000330050424500260053725000190056326400110058226400730059330000440066633600260071033700280073633800270076452005590079165000340135065000310138465000280141565000310144365000540147465000450152865000480157365000460162165000510166765000340171865000360175265000330178865000380182165000290185965000280188865500220191665500300193865500230196865500490199165500390204093800410207993800410212093800290216198001100219098100630230014244POOF2180227t20182018nyua          000 f eng d  a990839805a1021064088a1027754968  a9780062676139q(hardcover)  a006267613Xq(hardcover)1 aAU@b000062060381  a(OCoLC)1025328133  bHarpercollins, 53 Glenmaura National Blvd Ste 300, Moosaic, PA, USA, 18507-2132nSAN 200-2086  aT7BbengerdacT7BdT7BdOCLCOdLW1dDADdFMFdILCdTXMALdYDXdBTCTAdBDXdHQDdCN5O4dSXPdOCLCFdLIVdVP@dIUKdTXGONdOCLCQdIGAdKYCdOCLCOdOCLCQdNUIdCUYdUAB14aPS3602.A596bC46 201804a813/.62231 aBall, Jesse,d1978-eauthor.10aCensus /cJesse Ball.  aFirst edition. 4c¬©2018 1aNew York, NY :bEcco, an imprint of HarperCollinsPublishers,c[2018]  aix, 241 pages :billustrations ;c22 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aLearning that he does not have long to live, a widower needs to figure out how to provide for his developmentally disabled adult son.

As they approach "Z," the man must confront the purpose of the census, and decide how to say good-bye to his son. 0aVoyages and travelsvFiction. 0aFathers and sonsvFiction. 1aDown SyndromevFiction. 1aFathers and sonsvFiction. 7aCensus takers (Persons)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01893174 7aDown syndrome.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00897227 7aFathers and sons.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00921899 7aTerminally ill.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01147878 7aVoyages and travels.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01169308 7aFICTION / Dystopian.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Family Life.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Literary.2bisacsh 0aCensus takers (Persons)vFiction. 0aTerminally illvFiction. 0aDown syndromevFiction. 7aDystopias.2gsafd 7aDystopian fiction.2lcgft 4aDystopian fiction. 7aDystopian fiction.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01921637 7aFiction.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423787  aYBP Library ServicesbYANKn14622579  aBaker and TaylorbBTCPnBK0020959044  aBrodartbBRODn120344068  yfmm1@cornell.edu:g1sFred Muratorih521-olinzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/14244;Cornell  kUSDnNYTBR; NEW  & amp; NOTEWORTHY kUSDq;Rush:Yesi26.0002596cam a2200529 i 450000100060000000300060000600800410001201000170005301900270007002000260009702000290012302900220015203500210017404001030019504200080029805000270030608200150033310000300034824500490037825000190042726400960044630000230054233600260056533700280059133800270061952006100064665000240125665000500128065000330133065000460136365000330140965000340144265000330147665000430150965000500155265000290160265500390163165500240167065500330169465500360172765500190176393800410178293800290182393800410185298001100189398100630200314243POOF2171205s2018    nyu           000 f eng    a  2017054671  a1029056281a1029356331  a1631494139qhardcover  a9781631494130qhardcover1 aAU@b000061312564  a(OCoLC)988285733  aDLCbengerdacDLCdOCLCOdOCLCFdCN5O4dDADdOCLCOdBLPdIK2dCZAdZACdILCdOCLdYDXdOCLCOdIGA  apcc00aPS3613.C2653bH69 201800a813/.62231 aMcAllister, Tom,eauthor.10aHow to be safe :ba novel /cTom McAllister.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bLiveright Publishing Corporation, a division of W.

Though she is quickly exonerated, and the actual teenage murderer identified, her life is nevertheless held up for relentless scrutiny and judgment as this quiet town descends into media mania. This is a piercing feminist howl written in trenchant prose, a compulsively readable, darkly funny expos? of the hypocrisy that ensues when illusions of peace are shattered. 4aFICTION / Literary. 7aCity and town life.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00862081 0aLife change eventsvFiction. 7aWomen teachers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01178592 0aCity and town lifevFiction. 4aFICTION / Small Town & Rural. 7aFICTION / Literary.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Small Town & Rural.2bisacsh 7aLife change events.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00998231 0aWomen teachersvFiction. 7aFiction.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423787 7aBlack humor.2lcgft 7aSatirical literature.2lcgft 7aBlack humor (Literature)2gsafd 7aSatire.2gsafd  aYBP Library ServicesbYANKn14518674  aBrodartbBRODn120190494  aBaker and TaylorbBTCPnBK0020851559  yfmm1@cornell.edu:g1sFred Muratorih521-olinzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/14243;Cornell  kUSDnNYTBR; NEW  & amp; NOTEWORTHY kUSDq;Rush:Yesi25.9502152cam a2200493Ii 450000100060000000300060000600800410001201900150005302000150006802000180008303500220010104000960012305000240021908200150024310000270025824500360028525000190032126400490034030000230038933600260041233700280043833800270046652004270049365000360092065000290095665000310098565000310101665000290104765000260107665000360110265000480113865000260118665500290121265500190124165500270126065500220128765500340130965500310134393800410137493800290141593800410144498001100148598100630159514242POOF2180403s2018    nyu           000 f eng d  a1000584125  a1455561770  a9781455561773  a(OCoLC)1030306136  aCG4bengerdacCG4dCZAdOCLCOdSO$dBTCTAdYDXdBDXdHQDdCKEdBURdILCdTXLAMdGK8dPFLCL14aPS3610.U87bI3 201804a813/.62231 aJuska, Elise,eauthor.10aIf we had known /cElise Juska.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bGrand Central Publishing,c2018.  a314 pages ;c24 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aEnglish professor Maggie Daley and her college-student daughter struggle with guilt, fear, and the dangerous bonds of family in the aftermath of a mass shooting in their small New England town.
