Brian Willson was so shocked by the diabolical nature of the US war against Viet Nam -- irreversible knowledge, as he describes it -- and his own appalling ignorance from his cultural conditioning, that it sparked a lifetime of anti-war activism. This toxic jolt awakened him to the extent to which he and generations of American citizens had thoughtlessly succumbed to the relentless barrage of lies and propaganda that infest US American culture--from the military and political parties to religious institutions, academic and educational institutions, sports, fraternal and professional associations, the scientific community, the economic system, and all our entertainment--that seek to rationalize its otherwise inexplicable and morally repulsive behavior globally and at home. US American history reveals a unifying theme: prosperity for a few through expansion at any cost, to preserve the "exceptional" American Way of Life (AWOL). This has been structurally guided and facilitated by our nation's founding documents, including the US Constitution. From the beginning, the US was envisaged as a White male supremacist state serving to protect and advance the interests of private and commercial property, and this course has never been reversed, though the 1960s witnessed multiple aligned social movements. The US-waged war in Viet Nam was not an aberration, but one of hundreds of examples in a long pattern of brutal exploitation. A quick review of the empirical record reveals close to 600 overt military interventions by the US into dozens of countries since 1798, almost 400 since the end of World War II alone, and thousands of covert interventions since 1947"--cProvided by publisher.27aVietnam War (1961-1975)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01431664 7a1961-19752fast 7aMilitary policyxMoral and ethical aspects.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01021394 0aPolitical culturezUnited StatesxHistory. 0aVietnam War, 1961-1975zUnited States. 7aPolitical culture.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01069263 7aPolitical ethics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01069286 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationsxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aUnited StatesxMilitary policyxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmentxMoral and ethical aspects. 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst0141162808iOnline version:aWillson, S.

On the 13th May 1971, Private Bishop departed Australia on HMAS Sydney, having earned his place in the Fourth Royal Australian Regiment(4RAR)'s Second Tour of southern Vietnam via gruelling training regimes at Kapooka, Canungra, and Townsville.Shot through with larrikin spirit and dry humour, yet unflinchingly honest, KILLING BABIES recounts the narrator's journey into a war-zone which would test his valour, and an exotic world of sin city bars which would test his values. Through the vehicle of vivid memoirs Bishop transports us into the heart and mind of a young bushman who, by luck of the draw and by Government decree, becomes an ANZAC Digger.Bishop delivers rich detail and dialogue in the best bush yarn tradition, as we travel with him from Army Bases, back tracks, and night clubs, to South Vietnam's booby-trapped bamboo groves and rugged, jungle-clad ranges. In these pages Darryl Bishop invites you to sample the life he and his mates lived during the dying days of Australia's involvement in that most unpopular war." -- back cover.10aBishop, Darryl A.27aVietnam War (1961-1975)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01431664 7a1961-19752fast 0aVietnam War, 1961-1975vPersonal narratives, Australian. 7aPersonal narrativesvAustralian.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01424076  yjwp42@cornell.edu:g1sh8110-echzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/15018;Cornell  kUSDkUSDq;Rush:i2002431cam a22004578i 450000100060000000300060000600800410001201500210005301600250007401900150009902000150011402000310012902900220016003500220018204000350020404300210023905500250026008200230028508400180030808400170032610000340034324500880037726300090046526400650047430000140053933600260055333700280057933800270060750000770063452007480071153000380145960000240149765000360152165000330155765000510159065000340164165000370167577601380171298000980185098100250194815017POOF2180216s2018    nsc           000 0aeng    a201890082882can  a(AMICUS)000045287446  a1030262642  a1988286352  a9781988286358q(softcover)0 aNLCb000045287446  a(OCoLC)1035218830  aNLCbengerdacNLCdOCLCOdTOH  aa-vt---an-cn--- 0aHV640.5 V5bT36 201804a305.9/06914092223  acci1icc2lacc  acoll132lacc1 aTang, Thien,d1961-,eauthor.14aThe other side of the sun :bthe true story of one refugee's journey /cThien Tang.  a1804 1aEast Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia :bPottersfield Press,c2018.  apages cm.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aPreviously published: Cornwall, Prince Edward Island : Thien Tang, 2018.  a"As one of the "Boat People," Thien Tang escaped wartorn Vietnam on a harrowing journey that landed him in a Malaysian refugee camp.

Thien's ship was attacked by pirates and shot at by police. On land, the refugees were jailed, starved, and beaten, but survival only brought on tougher challenges.

But most of all it focuses on Cambodia and Vietnam, where he worked as a young diplomat, in 1959-61, before returning as a graduate student and academic. Later he was a consultant to UNHCR and the 'Cambodian Refugee Problem', working along the Thai-Cambodian border. It is a book where mordant humour is present but tragedy is all too often the dominating theme of life under Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's mercurial leader, and then Pol Pot's tyranny. His experiences in Vietnam offer a counterpoint to conventional accounts of that conflict, when he was a privileged observer of a war that seemed without end. Milton Osborne's early experience in Australia's Phnom Penh embassy has shaped the rest of his life, which remains centred on Southeast Asia. After completing his doctorate at Cornell and holding various academic appointments he returned to government service as Head of the Asia Branch of the Office of National Assessments in 1982. Since 1993 he has been a full-time writer and consultant on Southeast Asian subjects. He is the author of ten books including 'Southeast Asia: An Introductory History', now in its 12th edition.

According to the United Nations, they are one of the most persecuted minorities in the world. They suffer routine discrimination at the hands of neighboring Buddhist Rakhine groups, but international human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch (HRW) have also accused Myanmar's authorities of being complicit in a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya Muslims. The Rohingya face regular violence, arbitrary arrest and detention, extortion, and other abuses, a situation that has been particularly acute since 2012 in the wake of a serious wave of sectarian violence. Islam is practiced by around 4% of the population of Myanmar, and most Muslims also identify as Rohingya. Yet the authorities refuse to recognize this group as one of the 135 ethnic groups or 'national races' making up Myanmar's population. On this basis, Rohingya individuals are denied citizenship rights in the country of their birth, and face severe limitations on many aspects of an ordinary life, such as marriage or movement around the country.0This expose of the attempt to erase the Rohingyas from the face of Myanmar is sure to gain widespread attention. 0aEthnic conflictzBurma. 0aRohingya (Burmese people)xCivil rights. 0aBurmaxEthnic relations. 0aMuslimszBurma. 0aRohingya (Burmese people)xViolence against. 7aEthnic conflict.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00915943 0aMinoritieszBurma. 7aMuslims.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01031029 7aRohingya (Burmese people)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01099604 0aRohingya (Burmese people)zBurma. 7aMinorities.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01023088 7aBurma.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01207835  aYBP Library ServicesbYANKn14911472  aBrodartbBRODn121265919  yjwp42@cornell.edu:g1sh8141-echzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/15011;Cornell  kUSDnGet this 2018 2nd edition kUSDq;Rush:Yesi1504562cam a22006978i 450000100060000000300060000600600190001200700150003100800410004601000170008701900390010402000360014302000330017902000180021202000150023002000250024502000150027003500210028504000950030604200080040105000100040906000110041907200250043008200190045510000490047424500710052326300090059426400330060330000230063633600210065933700230068033800320070349000320073550400510076750502550081852012870107358801030236065000710246365000460253465000600258065000180264065000320265865000340269065000200272465500180274465500220276265500220278477601490280683000320295585601070298785601840309485600820327885601060336085600740346693800420354093800410358293800290362393800680365298001180372098100260383815010POOF2m     o  d        cr |||||||||||170718s2018    nju     ob    001 0 eng    a  2017034096  a1005914151a1006411205a1021249271  a9781118917787q(electronic bk.)  a1118917782q(electronic bk.)  z9781118918166  z1118918177  z9781118918173 (pbk.)  z1118918169  a(OCoLC)994206265  aDLCbengerdacDLCdOCLCOdN$TdIDEBKdN$TdOCLCFdOCLCOdNRCdEBLCPdYDXdIDBdOSUdOCLCO  apcc10aSF99110aSF 991 7aTECx0030202bisacsh00a636.7/08962231 aWray, Jonq(Jonathan David),d1973-eauthor.10aCanine internal medicine :bwhat's your diagnosis? /cby Jon Wray.  a1712 1aHoboken, NJ :bWiley,c2018.  a1 online resource.  atext2rdacontent  acomputer2rdamedia  aonline resource2rdacarrier1 aWhat's Your Diagnosis?

It analyses temples and communities in historical and contemporary perspective, the diversity of deities and Chinese speech groups, religious specialists and temple services, the communal significance of the Hungry Ghosts Festival, the relationship between religion and philanthropy as seen through the lens of such Chinese religious organization as 'shantang' (benevolent halls) and Dejiao (Moral Uplifting Societies), as well as the development and transformation of Taoist Religion. This concise book contributes to an understanding of Chinese migration and settlement, political economy and religion, religion and identity politics as well the significance of religion to both individuals and communities. 7aTemples.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01147397 0aChinesezMalaysiaxReligion. 7aChinesexReligion.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00857210 0aTempleszMalaysia. 7aMalaysia.2fast0(OCoLC)fst0120459008iOnline version:aTan, Chee-Beng.tChinese religion in Malaysia.dLeiden ; Boston : Brill, 2018z9789004357877w(DLC)  2018005257  aYBP Library ServicesbYANKn14970590  aYBP Library ServicesbYANKnci36425795  aErasmus BoekhandelbERAAnNTS0000270499  aOtto HarrassowitzbHARRnhar185006150  yjwp42@cornell.edu:g1sh8110-echzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/15007;Cornell  kUSDkUSDq;Rush:i8000990cam a2200265Mi 450000100060000000300060000600800410001202000150005302000180006802400190008602900210010503500220012604000270014810000640017524501170023926000280035630000430038433600310042733700350045833800290049365100360052265100430055898000980060198100250069915006POOF2180129s2017    ne            000 0 eng d  a9463011668  a97894630116628 aNSTC 5001217980 aNLGGCb416438784  a(OCoLC)1028749215  aNLGGCbduterdacNLGGC1 aRavesteijn, Wimq(Willem),d1954-4aut0(NL-LeOCL)15953852110aEngineering the Dutch empire :birrigation, the colonial state and ideology in Java 1832-1942 /cWim Ravesteijn.  aDelft :bEburon,c2017.  a435 pagina's :billustraties ;c25 cm.  atekstbtxt2rdacontent/dut  azonder mediumbn2rdamedia/dut  abandbnc2rdacarrier/dut 7aJava.2gtt0(NL-LeOCL)078551552 7aIndonesië.2gtt0(NL-LeOCL)078544114  yjwp42@cornell.edu:g1sh8144-echzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/15006;Cornell  kUSDkUSDq;Rush:i4502816cam a2200565Ki 450000100060000000300060000600600190001200700150003100800410004602000360008702000330012302000180015602000150017403500210018903700840021004000500029405000240034408200140036810000370038224501560041924600410057525000190061626400530063526400110068830000580069933600260075733700260078333800360080949000350084550400670088050502650094758800260121265000140123865000190125265000550127165000290132665000150135565000450137065000410141565000400145665500220149670000460151877601460156483000360171085600870174685601140183385601120194798001180205998100730217715005POOF2m     o  d        cr cnu---unuuu150806s2015    nyua    ob    001 0 eng d  a9780393709094q(electronic bk.)  a0393709094q(electronic bk.)  z9780393707953  z0393707954  a(OCoLC)916067461  aF1CAE596-DB57-4312-AD3E-EC968D6E7CDAbOverDrive, Inc.nhttp://www.overdrive.com  aTEFODbengerdaepncTEFODdTEFODdOCLCQdOCL 4aBF321b.R364 2015eb04a158.12231 aMischke-Reeds, Manuela,eauthor.10a8 keys to practicing mindfulness :bpractical strategies for emotional health and well-being /cManuela Mischke Reeds ; foreword by Babette Rothschild.3 aEight keys to practicing mindfulness  aFirst edition. 1aNew York, N.Y. :bW.W.

As outlined in the concise introduction, pathogenic protozoans represent an evolutionary highly diverse and little understood group of disease-causing microorganisms. For each of the featured parasitic unicellular eukaryotes, it discusses the morphology, lifecycle, epidemiology and host-pathogen interactions. In addition, the book highlights the latest developments in diagnostic methods, as well as prevention and treatment strategies. Thorough information on genomes and genetic manipulation strategies for some of the protozoa covered in this book is also included. Infections involving parasitic protozoa can cause productivity losses and/or reduce the quality of life of infected animals. Some infections are zoonotic, posing an on-going public health threat. In most cases, prevention and treatment are either non-existent or need considerable improvement. On the other hand, a great deal of research has recently been conducted on these organisms, yielding valuable new information on their global distribution and revealing the mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level - and essential insights that can be used for the development of new control tools. This book includes extensive information on both basic aspects and recent scientific discoveries on these protozoa and thus constitutes a unique resource for students, veterinarians, and researchers alike.0 aOnline resource;

Troubling tones -- Part III. The vanishing twin.  aLisbeth Salander is an unstoppable force: sentenced to two months in Flodberga women's prison for saving a young boy's life by any means necessary, Salander refuses to say anything in her own defence. She has more important things on her mind. Mikael Blomkvist makes the long trip to visit every week - and receives a lead to follow for his pains. For him, it looks to be an important exposé for Millennium. For her, it could unlock the facts of her childhood. Even from a corrupt prison system run largely by the inmates, Salander will stand up for what she believes in, whatever the cost. And she will seek the truth that is somehow connected with her childhood memory, of a woman with a blazing birthmark on her neck - that looked as if it had been burned by a dragon's fire ...17aSalander, Lisbethc(Fictitious character)2fast0(OCoLC)fst0176426317aBlomkvist, Mikaelc(Fictitious character)2fast0(OCoLC)fst0192382610aSalander, Lisbethc(Fictitious character)vFiction.10aBlomkvist, Mikaelc(Fictitious character)vFiction. 0aHackersvFiction. 0aJournalistszSwedenvFiction. 7aHackers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00872150 7aJournalists.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00984188 7aSweden.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204537 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft 7aThrillers (Fiction)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726755 7aFiction.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423787 4aSwedish fiction. 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726581 0aSwedish fictiony21st century.1 aGoulding, Georgec(Translator),etranslator.08iEbook versionz9780857056443 0aMillennium (Norstedts förlag) ;vbk. 5.  aYBP Library ServicesbYANKn14299172  ypjs3@cornell.edu:g1sh2513-olinzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/14994;Cornell  kUSDnOn Amazon.

But from there, the book expands its reach. At its core, "cursed" thinking underlies almost everything people write, say, and think about both other people and our own pasts. The more information we have about something, and the more experience we have with it, the harder it is to step outside that experience. What unfolds is both a fresh approach to mental heuristics and biases and an ambitious work of cognitive literary criticism. Elements of Surprise provides a new and exciting way of thinking about the mechanics of narrative, explored through thoughtful readings of classic, popular, and obscure texts.--cProvided by publisher. 7aCognition.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00866457 0aNarration (Rhetoric) 0aCognition. 0aLiterary anatomies. 7aLiterary anatomies.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00999913 7aNarration (Rhetoric)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032927 0aSurprise in literature. 7aSurprise in literature.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01139535 0aPlots (Drama, novel, etc.) 7aPlots (Drama, novel, etc.)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01067227  aYBP Library ServicesbYANKn14774870  aBaker and TaylorbBTCPnBK0021483631  aBrodartbBRODn121226034  yfmm1@cornell.edu:g1sFred Muratorih521-olinzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/14989;Cornell  kUSDnXBO;  Harvard Univ.

An introduction to the volume as a whole addresses the most significant features of the included writings and contextualizes them within the contemporary (quickly evolving) study of the Christian Apocrypha. The body of the book comprises thirty texts that have been carefully introduced, annotated, and translated into readable English by eminent scholars. Ranging from the second century to early in the second millennium, these fascinating texts provide a more complete picture of Christian thought and expression than canonical texts alone can offer"--Provided by publisher.07aApokryphen2gnd07a"Bible.

The aim of the conference was to highlight convergences and divergences in the treatment of verbal adjectives and participles across the Indo-European languages, modern as well as ancient. It is well-known that the border between these two classes may fluctuate in synchrony and diachrony and reveals an intricate interplay of morphology, syntax and semantics.1 aPinault, Georges-Jean.1 aPetit, Daniel.1 aLe Feuvre, Claire.  aLibrarie ErasmusbERAPnNTS0000274997  ypjs3@cornell.edu:g1sh592-olinzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/14985;Cornell  kUSDnhttp://www.hempen-verlag.de/verbal-adjectives-and-participles-in-indo-european-languages-adjectifs-verbaux-et-participes-dans-les-langues-indo-europeennes.html.

Drawing on in-depth historical research and sensitively listening to contemporary patients in Morocco, she offers both an ethnographic journey through madness and contemporary formations of despair and a philosophical and theological exploration of the vicissitudes of the soul. Pandolfo's study spans a breadth that encompasses experiences of psychosis in psychiatric hospitals, visionary torments of the soul in urban life, the difficulty of undocumented migration, and the liturgical space of Quranic healing. Demonstrating how contemporary Islamic cures for madness address some of the core preoccupations of the psychoanalytic approach, she reveals how a religious and ethical relation to the "ordeal" of madness might actually allow for spiritual transformation. Altogether, this work illuminates new dimensions of psychoanalysis and the ethical imagination while also sensitively examining the collective psychic strife that so many communities endure today.0 aPrint version record. 0aMental illnessxAlternative treatmentzMorocco. 0aIslam and psychoanalysiszMorocco. 0aIslamzMoroccoxCustoms and practices. 0aPastoral psychology (Islam) 0aMental healthzMoroccoxReligious aspectsxIslam. 7aRELIGION / Islam / General2bisacsh 4aElectronic books.08iPrint version:aPandolfo, Stefania.tKnot of the soul.dChicago : The University of Chicago Press, 2017z9780226464923w(DLC)  2017006640w(OCoLC)973880014403EBSCOhostuhttp://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=1463660  aEBSCOhostbEBSCn1463660  yah16@cornell.edu:g1sali houissah2115-olinzPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/14984;Cornell  kUSDnXBO
