Because these moves are central across all disciplines, the book includes chapters on writing in the sciences, writing in the social sciences, and writing about literature. 0aReport writingvHandbooks, manuals, etc. 0aPersuasion (Rhetoric)vHandbooks, manuals, etc. 7aPersuasion (Rhetoric)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01058895 7aReport writing.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01094836 0aEnglish languagexRhetoricvHandbooks, manuals, etc. 7aEnglish languagexRhetoric.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00911581 7aHandbooks and manuals.2fast0(OCoLC)fst014238771 aBirkenstein, Cathy,eauthor.1 aDurst, Russel K.,d1954-eauthor.  aBaker and TaylorbBTCPnBK0019513281  yokureserve@cornell.edu:g1shp7358-uriszPOOF;http://poof2.library.cornell.edu/orders/17169;Cornell  kUSDnPlease purchase one physical copy per instructor request - https://www.amazon.com/They-Say-Academic-Writing-Readings/dp/0393617440 RES:MEDVL 1101 Fall 2018kUSDq;Rush:Yesi42.00
